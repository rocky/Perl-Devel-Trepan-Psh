Devel::Trepan::Psh -- interactive shell support for Devel::Trepan
==================================================================

An interactive shell command for [Devel::Trepan](https://github.com/rocky/Perl-Devel-Trepan/wiki).

shell via <i>Psh</i> pulls in lots of other packages. Thus we
have this separated this portion.

<i>Devel::Trepan</i> debugger, <i>trepan.pl</i>. The command goes into
a <i>Psh</i> shell from inside the debugger.
